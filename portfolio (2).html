	    <p><font size="6">I'm 16 years old and was born here in San Diego. Some of my hobbies
	    
	    include playing tennis and traveling around the world. So far I've been
	    
	    to all six continents except for Antarctica. This December however, I'm 
	    
	    travelling to Southern Chile and making a day trip to King George
	    
	    Island in Antarctica. Much of my time is consumed by homework and golf
	    
	    practice. I love golf and am fortunate enough to play on RB's varsity
	    
	    team.</font></p>

			<p><font size="6" > Using python I created this graph relating suicide between men and women. Here is the question: Who commits suicide more freuquently, males or females?
			Answer: Males commit suicide more often. The graph shows that even in other countries where the overall suicide rate is higher, the difference in suicide between males and females
			is largely different, with males more likely to do it. For example, in Japan, the green line representing males shows that they are more likely to commit suicide than the
			orange line of females suicide.</font></p>
